# SQLSubmittalReports
SQL report matching all submittals in Procore (submittal_logs table) with what has been submitting in the Coreworx (Rev_Stat_All table) primary document management system. Data needs to be cleaned before joining both tables.

Views were created to show outstanding submittals or submittals requiring resubmittal.
